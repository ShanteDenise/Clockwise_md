# Clockwise_md
 Project #4: Final Project (UX/WD Collab Group Variant)


# ** Clockwise_md **


Shante Austin - Rashad Flemming - Brittany Lewis

For our 4th and final class project, we have chosen to build a Django and React app for ClockwiseMD. The important differeance from our previous projects will be identifying our Minimum Viable Product and what can be accomplished, as a team, within a week while keeping our goals achievable so that we can guarantee a working prototype at the end of the project week. We focused on keeping things small, mastering the fundamentals, and avoiding scoope creep/feature creep habits. We identified what we needed to build and kept it organized with a team trello board:
